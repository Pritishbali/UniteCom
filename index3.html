        <p>
            LGBTQ individuals use a variety of terms to identify themselves and their communities. <br />
            Individual and societal understanding of sexuality and gender identity are constantly changing.<br />
            Resources in this section provide definitions for some of the more commonly used terms,<br />
            as well as some basic information on history, language, myths and facts, and answers to<br />
            frequently asked questions relating to LGBTQ communities.

        <h1> MENTAL HEALTH OF CHILDREN -</h1>
        <br />

        <p>
            Mental disorders can begin in childhood. Examples include anxiety disorders,<br />
            attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), autism spectrum disorder, depression<br />
            and other mood disorders, eating disorders, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).<br />
            Without treatment, these mental health conditions can prevent children from reaching <br />
            their full potential. Many adults who seek mental health treatment reflect on the impact<br />
            of mental disorders on their childhood and wish they had received help sooner.

        <h1> BEHAVIOURAL CHANGES IN CHILDREN - </h1>
        <br />
        <p>
            Children sometimes argue, are aggressive, or act angry or defiant around adults.<br />
            A behavior disorder may be diagnosed when these disruptive behaviors are uncommon <br />
            for the childâ€™s age at the time, persist over time, or are severe.  Because disruptive<br />
            behavior disorders involve acting out and showing unwanted behavior towards others they<br />
            are sometimes called externalizing disorders.
